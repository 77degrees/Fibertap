# Fibertap Project Overview

## Mission

Protect family privacy by monitoring for personal data exposure and automating removal through Incogni integration.

## Problem Statement

Personal data ends up on data broker sites, people-search engines, and in breach databases. Manually tracking and removing this data is time-consuming and requires constant vigilance. Families need a unified way to monitor multiple people's exposure and take action.

## Solution

Fibertap provides:

1. **Unified Family Dashboard** - Monitor data exposure for all family members in one place
2. **Automated Scanning** - Regular checks against data brokers, breach databases, and people-search sites
3. **Incogni Integration** - One-click submission of removal requests through existing Incogni subscription
4. **Alert System** - Notifications when new exposures are detected
5. **Removal Tracking** - Monitor the status of pending removal requests

## Target Users

- Privacy-conscious individuals and families
- Existing Incogni subscribers who want better visibility and control
- People who have experienced identity theft or data breaches

## Success Metrics

- Number of data exposures detected
- Removal request success rate
- Time from detection to removal initiation
- Family member coverage (all members actively monitored)
