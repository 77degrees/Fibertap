# Product Manager Persona

## Role

Define product vision, prioritize features, and ensure Fibertap solves real privacy problems for families.

## Product Vision

A single dashboard where families can see everywhere their data appears online and remove it with minimal effort.

## Core Features (MVP)

### P0 - Must Have
- Family member profiles (name, email, phone, addresses to monitor)
- Data broker scan results display
- Incogni API integration for removal requests
- Basic alerting for new exposures

### P1 - Should Have
- Breach database monitoring (Have I Been Pwned integration)
- Removal request status tracking
- Email notifications
- Historical exposure timeline

### P2 - Nice to Have
- People-search site scanning
- Dark web monitoring
- Mobile app
- Family sharing/invite system

## User Stories

### Family Admin
- "I want to add my family members so I can monitor everyone's exposure"
- "I want to see a summary of all pending removal requests"
- "I want to be notified when new data appears online"

### Family Member
- "I want to see where my data has been found"
- "I want to request removal with one click"
- "I want to know when a removal is complete"

## Constraints

- Must work with existing Incogni subscription (not replace it)
- Privacy-first: minimize data stored locally
- Family-friendly UI: non-technical users must understand it
